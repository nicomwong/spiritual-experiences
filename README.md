## ~9.15.22 - 10.25.22

Meditation: (Writing this on 12.22.22) I was kind of stuck in a semi-"dream" state. Everything felt like a dream, but it also felt very lacking. I wanted to go back to the world. And so, I did, and I gradually returned to the world. I remember this type of state was documented as a common one to enter in some online buddhist-like website. Anyways, I would not recommend it, but I'm not sure if it's inevitable or not. Maybe, try not to fall into a dream state. I heard that one reason for it could be that I meditated too much while sleepy and tired. Maybe meditate only when alert and awake, in the awake state. That's what I would do if I had to do it again.
